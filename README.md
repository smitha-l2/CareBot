## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "Add your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized production files.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment-specific configurations:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## API Integration

The frontend is ready for backend integration. Update the following areas:

1. **Chat functionality** in `App.js` - Connect to your Carebot API
2. **File upload** - Integrate with your file processing service
3. **Authentication** - Add user authentication if required

## Deployment

### Deploy to Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `build` folder to Netlify

### Deploy to Vercel
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel`
3. Follow the prompts

## Security Considerations

- All file uploads should be validated on the backend
- Implement proper authentication for production use
- Use HTTPS in production
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Follow HIPAA compliance guidelines for healthcare data

## Performance Optimization

- Images are optimized for web
- Code splitting is implemented via React.lazy (when needed)
- CSS is optimized for minimal bundle size
- Service worker can be added for offline functionality

## Accessibility

The application follows accessibility best practices:
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color scheme
- Screen reader compatibility

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

For coverage reports:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 already in use**
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
   ```

2. **npm install fails**
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
   - Run `npm install` again

3. **Build fails**
   - Check for ESLint errors
   - Ensure all imports are correct
   - Verify environment variables
